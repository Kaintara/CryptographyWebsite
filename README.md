# CryptographyWebsite
A website in which people can learn about asymmetric encryption, find out about popular methods that are used today, learn about the mathematical theory behind them, and try it out for themselves.

This website covers three different types of encryption methods: RSA, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, and elliptic curve cryptography. Each page details how they work and gives the user the ability to generate public/private keys to demonstrate the methods.

I made this website because I'm interested in both maths and computer science, and I wanted to express my interest through a project which culminated all the research I had done on the topic so others can have an easier time understanding asymmetric encryption than I did when I first started looking into it.

The most challenging part of this project was writing the mathematical algorithms, such as the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Being able to implement them in code has helped me understand them better; before, I understood the concepts/theorems but couldn't apply them.

I am a beginner at web development, so I've learned a decent amount of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from developing this website, with a lot of focus on how to use canvas to draw images to the webpage for the graphs, webpage background, and the 'mod' clock. Additionally, I learned a lot about event listeners, which was vital for the interactivity of this website.
