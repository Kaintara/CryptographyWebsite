            <p>The Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) encryption method is used to generate a secure public key once a private key has been chosen, relying on Euler’s theorem and Bézout’s identity. These are two mathematical results that, when combined with large prime numbers, make it possible to construct key pairs with a unique one-way relationship: encryption with the public key can only be reversed by the corresponding private key.</p>

            <h2>What is Euler’s theorem</h2>
            <p>Euler’s theorm states: <span>m<sup>𝚽(n)</sup> ≡ 1 (mod n)</span> - but what is <b>𝚽(n)</b> you ask? That is Euler’s Totient Function aka the Phi Function as <b>𝚽</b> is the greek letter <b>'phi'</b>. This function outputs the number for any integer <b>n</b> the amount of coprimes <b>n</b> has, where <b>m</b> is coprime with <b>n</b> if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is equal to 1, <b>gcd(m,n) = 1</b>. For example <b>𝚽(10)</b> = <b>4</b> as 1, 3, 7, and 9 all share the greatest common divisor of <b>1</b> with <b>10</b>.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">List of the Phi function applied to the first twenty natural numbers:</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">In the list, do you notice anything special about the outputs of the prime numbers?</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you hadn't noticed already, the output of the phi function when prime numbers are inputted seem to be that number minus one. 𝚽(11) = 10 or 𝚽(11) = 11 - 1. This is due to the fact that prime numbers only share a common factor with 1 and themselves. Meaning all numbers less than p, a random prime, except 1 is coprime with p. Therefore 𝚽(p) = (p -1). This is extremely useful as to calculate the output of the phi function otherwise has a time complexity of O(n), making it extremely inefficient to find when dealing with large numbers that are not prime. <span id="ital">(This is important later...)</span></p>

            <h2>What is Bézout’s identity?</h2>
            <p>Bezout’s identity states that where the integers a and b have the greatest common divisor of d ( gcd(a,b) = d ), they are integers which satisfy this equation - ay + bx = d. This can be used in addtion with Euler's Theorem to create a general formula for composite functions that are incredibly difficult to reverse engineer.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">RSA Mathematical Proof!</h2>
            <div class="col">
                <p>Starting off by stating the two integers <b>m</b> and <b>n</b> as coprimes of each other, they can be inputted into Euler’s theorem giving this result - <b>m<sup>𝚽(n)</sup> ≡ 1 (mod n)</b>.</p>
                <p>Then using <b>k</b> as any positive integer, increase the power by <b>k</b> on both sides: <b>m<sup>k𝚽(n)</sup> ≡ 1<sup>k</sup> (mod n)</b></p>
                <p>1 to the power of any positive integer is 1 therefore it can be rewritten to this: <b>m<sup>k𝚽(n)</sup> ≡ 1  (mod n)</b></p>
                <p>Multiply both sides by m to get this result - <b>m*m<sup>k𝚽(n)</sup> ≡ 1*m  (mod n)</b></p>
                <p><b>m<sup>k𝚽(n) + 1</sup>  ≡ m  (mod n)</b></p>
                <p>Bezout’s identity then can be used by stating <b>k𝚽(n) + 1 = ed</b> where <b>gcd(𝚽(n),e) = 1, k and d</b> are the integers which satisfy the equation. </p>
                <p>Substituting <b>e</b> and <b>d</b> into the equation results in <b>m<sup>ed</sup>  ≡ m  (mod n)</b> </p>
                <p>This leaves us with composite functions: <b>f(m) = m<sup>e</sup> mod n</b> and <b>g(m) = m<sup>d</sup> mod n</b> so that <b>gf(m) = m</b>.</p>
                <p>This proof can then be applied as a method of asymmetric encryption where <b>m</b> is the message/data being encrypted, f(m) is the function to encrypt and g(m) is the function to decrypt. As f(m) = m<sup>e</sup> mod n, the public key would be <b>(e,n)</b>. Therefore, the private key would be <b>(d,n)</b> as g(m) = m<sup>d</sup> mod n.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Generating Private and Public Keys</h2>
            <p>The proof above shows how the RSA works as an asymmetric method but it doesn’t show how exactly it is secure or how to generate e,d and n as they can’t just be <b>any</b> integer. For RSA to be a secure encryption method, a large product of two primes must be used as <b>n</b>. It is extremely difficult to calculate due to it being the product of two large primes ensuring security. As <b>𝚽(p) = (p-1)</b>, due to the phi function being multiplicative, <b>𝚽(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)</b> where <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> are two random large prime numbers. So if <b>n = pq</b>, 𝚽(n) is easy to calculate as it simply equals <b>(p-1)(q-1)</b>. As 𝚽(n) is necessary to derive d, p and q are not shared publicly making the private key <b>(d,n)</b> is near impossible to calculate as without <b>p</b> and <b>q</b>, 𝚽(n)</b> is extremely difficult to compute.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To generate e and d, Bezout’s identity must be used as it defined the relationship between, e, d and 𝚽(n) in the proof to derive the encryption and decryption functions. As stated before, <b>gcd(𝚽(n),e) = 1</b>, therefore <b>e</b> needs to be a coprime to <b>𝚽(n)</b>. <b>e</b> can be any number coprime with <b>𝚽(n)</b>, between 1 and 𝚽(n)</b> (exclusive) and be chosen at random. From the values of <b>e</b> and <b>𝚽(n)</b>, a range for <b>d</b> can be derived. As we know e is coprime with n, <b>k𝚽(n) + 1 = de </b>which implies <b>1 ≡ de (mod 𝚽(n))</b>. As you already know, <b>𝚽(n)</b> and <b>e</b> so you can choose any value for <b>d</b> which satisfies this equation.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Below is an example, try out changing the vaules of p,q and e to see how many potential private keys you generate!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Pick a number for <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> first, let’s say <span class="ptext">17</span> and <span class="qtext">3</span> making <b>n</b> = <span class="ntext">51</span>. <b>𝚽(n)</b> would be <span class="phiNtext">32</span> as <b>(<span class="ptext">17</span>-1)(<span class="qtext">3</span>-1) = <span class="phiNtext">32</span></b>. A good number that is coprime to <span class="phiNtext">32</span> would be <span class="etext">19</span> so <span class="etext">19</span> will be the <b>e</b> value. This leaves the public key as <b>(<span class="etext">19</span>,<span class="phiNtext">32</span>)</b>. To derive <b>d</b>, a value that satisfies this equation, <b>1 ≡ <span class="etext">19</span>d (mod <span class="phiNtext">32</span>)</b> needs to be calculated. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is used to do this resulting in <b>d = <span class="dtext">27</span></b>, making our private key <b>(<span class="dtext">27</span>, <span class="phiNtext">32</span>)</b>.</p>
