            <p>Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method for two people to establish a shared private key while communicating over a public channel. Its security relies on modular exponentiation — a type of calculation that is easy to perform in one direction but extremely difficult to reverse without special knowledge. Since modular exponentiation is built on modular arithmetic, we’ll need to explore that first.</p>
            <h2>What is Modular Arithmetic?</h2>
            <p>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value called the modulus. A good example is a 12-hour clock: it only shows numbers from 1 to 12, so after 12, it wraps around to 1 again. In modular terms, this means 13 ≡ 1 (mod 12), 14 ≡ 2 (mod 12) and so on.</p>

            <p>For example, using a shift key of 5 the word Encryption becomes <b>Jshwuynts</b>. Try using the slider and the cipher table to decrypt this message: <b>Jxyi mqi uqio</b>. (Hint! The Shift Key is 16...) Pretty simple, right? Well this type of cipher is called symmetric encryption as the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt. That makes it super easy for someone who shouldn’t have access to encrypted data to decrypt it if they found out what the key is.</p>
            <p>Due to this, asymmetric encryption is mostly used today as it uses two different keys; a public key and a private key. A public key is used to encrypt a message and a private key is used to decrypt. This makes encryption even more secure as attackers can’t decrypt data even if they have the public key. This website explores how asymmetric encryption works and different examples of it.</p>
            <h2>Basis of Aysmmetric encryption</h2>
            <p>Before you can dive into the intricacies of how specific asymmetric algorithms work, it is easier to understand more generally how exactly two different keys can be applied to encrypt and decrypt data. The basic principle of asymmetric encryption can be explained using composite functions. A public key is applied to the data first, let’s represent this as a function f() and apply it to the data, f(data) which would be the encrypted data. To decrypt this data, another function g() is used which we’ll use to represent the private key. Applying g on f(data) should return the original data, where g(f(data)) = data. As f() is a public key, the data stays secure where f() is extremely difficult and inefficient to inverse so anyone without the private key, g() cannot decrypt the data.</p>
