            <p>Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method for two people to establish a shared private key while communicating over a public channel. Its security relies on modular exponentiation — a type of calculation that is easy to perform in one direction but extremely difficult to reverse without special knowledge. Since modular exponentiation is built on modular arithmetic, we’ll need to explore that first.</p>
            <h2>What is Modular Arithmetic?</h2>
            <p>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value called the modulus. A good example is a 12-hour clock: it only shows numbers from 1 to 12, so after 12, it wraps around to 1 again. In modular terms, this means 13 ≡ 1 (mod 12), 14 ≡ 2 (mod 12) and so on. This states both sides leave the same remainder when divided by 12 as the modulo operation returns the remainder after division. Because of this the result of the modulo operation is always between 0 and one less than the modulus which causes the numbers to ‘wrap around’. Using the clock below and the modulus operation, you can convert the time from 24-hour to 12-hour format demonstrating this example.</p>
