            <h1>Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="overlayHeading2">
            <p>Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method for two people to establish a shared private key while communicating over a public channel. Its security relies on modular exponentiation — a type of calculation that is easy to perform in one direction but extremely difficult to reverse without special knowledge. Since modular exponentiation is built on modular arithmetic, we’ll need to explore that first.</p>
            <h2>What is Modular Arithmetic?</h2>
            <p>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value called the modulus. A good example is a 12-hour clock: it only shows numbers from 1 to 12, so after 12, it wraps around to 1 again. In modular terms, this means 13 ≡ 1 (mod 12), 14 ≡ 2 (mod 12) and so on. This states both sides leave the same remainder when divided by 12 as the modulo operation returns the remainder after division. Because of this the result of the modulo operation is always between 0 and one less than the modulus which causes the numbers to ‘wrap around’. Using the clock below and the modulus operation, you can convert the time from 24-hour to 12-hour format demonstrating this example.</p>

                <input type="range" id="slider1" min="1" max="11" value="1">
                <p>Time: <span id="sliderinfo">13:00</span></p>
                <p>Equivalent to <span id="sliderinfo2">13 mod 12</span>, therefore it is <span id="sliderinfo3">1 pm</span>.</p>
            </div>
            <script src="clock.js"></script>
            <p>This shows that modular exponentiation is just the application of modular arithmetic and exponents. Where a base number is raised to a power of an exponent and the modulo operation is then applied to it. This can be written as <b>b<sup>e</sup> mod n</b> where <b>b</b> is the base, <b>e</b> is the exponent, and <b>n</b> is the modulus.</p>
            <h2>How Diffie-Hellman Works</h2>
            <p>The two users wanting to create a private key would both choose a number as their secret key, <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> which they keep to themselves. Then they agree on a base, <b>b</b> and a modulus, <b>m</b>, which they share publicly. Both users apply their secret key as an exponent to the shared base and then share the remainder of this value divided by the shared modulus publicly. So <b>b<sup>x</sup> (mod m)</b> and <b>b<sup>y</sup> (mod m)</b> are exchanged between the users. They then use this value as their new base, using their own secret key and exponent again to calculate their own shared private key. So user 1 would do <b>(b<sup>y</sup>)<sup>x</sup> (mod m)</b> and user 2 would do <b>(b<sup>x</sup>)<sup>y</sup> (mod m)</b> which are equal. <b>b<sup>xy</sup> (mod m)</b> becomes the shared private key.</p>

            <h2>How Diffie-Hellman is Secure</h2>
            <p>Diffie-Hellman is secure due to the Discrete Logarithm Problem. This problem suggests there is no efficient way to calculate the modular exponents <b>x</b> or <b>y</b> using the base, modulus or using the resulting value, <b>b<sup>x</sup> (mod m)</b>. As these are the values shared publicly that could be intercepted, the discrete logarithm problem stops the resulting value from being inversed to calculate the exponents which are necessary to calculate the resulting shared private key. </p>

            <h2>Picking a Good Base and Modulus!</h2>
            <p>Additionally, the example used a base of <b>1</b>.No matter what positive exponent that is used, it will always return <b>1</b> even after the modulo operation has been applied to it. A good choice of a base would be the primitive root modulo <b>n</b>. This is a number, when used as a base, which returns all possible results that can be outputted by the modulo operation using <b>n</b> as the modulus. There are only primitive roots for <b>n</b> = <b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>4</b>, <b>p<sup>k</sup></b> or <b>2p<sup>k</sup></b> where <b>p</b> is an odd prime. This is another reason why choosing a large prime for the modulus is useful.</p>
