        </div>
        <div id="overlayHeading2">
            <p>Elliptic Curves are used to create digital signatures that ensure authenticity in the ownership of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This is due to a special property of Elliptic Curves that not only creates a harder version of the discrete logarithm problem but also generates significantly smaller private and public keys in practice.</p>
            <h2>What is an Elliptic Curve?</h2>
            <p>An Elliptic curve is a 2D curve which has the general equation <b>y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + ax + b</b> . Elliptic curves usually look like the graph below but vary in shape based on the variables a and b.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">The curve below has this equation, <b>y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> <span id="atext">+ x</span> <span id="btext">+ 100</span>.</b></p>

            <h2>How does Elliptic curve cryptography work?</h2>
            <p>Elliptic curves have a special property which allows two points to be ‘added’ to get another point on the curve. Any line that goes through an elliptic curve can only have at most three points of intersection so to add two points, a line must be drawn that intersects those two points and another point on the elliptic curve. Reflect this point over the x-axis and that is the addition of those two points.</p>
            <p>For Elliptic curve cryptography a single point is multiplied by adding itself multiple times. To do this, a tangent is drawn to the curve at the chosen point. The next point of intersection on the curve with that tangent is reflected across the x-axis. The chosen point is called the Generator Point. The private key is the random number picked to multiply the generator point to generate a public key. Therefore, when a known elliptic curve is used over a finite field <b>P = dG</b> where <b>P</b> is the public key, <b>d</b> is the private key and <b>G</b> is the generator point.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">The Equation of this Elliptic curve is <span>y<sup>2</sup>= x<sup>3</sup> - 10x + 100</span></p>

           <h2>What is a Finite Field?</h2>
           <p>A finite field is simply a set range of values that the elliptic curve can take.  By using the modulo operation, elliptic curves can be confined to a finite field; it will only output a discrete amount of integers. When a large prime is used as the modulus, there is no efficient way to calculate how many times <b>G</b> was multiplied to result in <b>P</b>. This inefficiency is labeled the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm problem which is considered harder than the Diffie-Hellman Discrete Logarithm problem, suggesting that this method is more secure. As well as the fact, private and public keys can be considerably shorter as compared to RSA as large primes are not required to make the method secure.</p>
